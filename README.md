# Day-3-Bio
What I am most excited about learning in this class is Python and utilizing the language for financial analysis. I would like to learn how to code and build financial models out of this class. Furthermore, I am hoping to learn how to prepare for interview case questions or coding problems. Given my accounting background, I would like to use it to build upon the finance curriculum that I will be learning.

Understanding how to use coding to build financial models as well as macros is what my goal is by the end of this class. I am also excited to learn how logic is being implemented in each language. With it, I am hoping to understand which languages going forward I could reference for financial analysis. 

What I am hoping to get out of this course is to permanently pivot out of accounting and into more of a financial analysis role. Any sort of investment firm with an emphasis on tech is ideal. I am also open to learning about tech industry positions as well. The coding skills I will learn is what I am looking forward to as this will set me slightly apart from the general business background.
